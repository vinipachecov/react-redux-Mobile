This repositor has my personal code for a course in Udemy platform named The Complete React Native and Redux Course by Stephen Grider.

In this course we build a few apps to understand the concepts behind React Native application development. 
The apps buildded grows in complexity and the concepts that are used/introduced. 

As I don't have a Mac(yet) the apps were built only for Android Devices. Anyone is free to build for IOS but some the layout display differently.

* All apps were built for educational purposes and were not meant to be professional apps.

# Running

1. Install npm and go to a specific project path (albums, auth, techstack, manager).

2. Install the dependencies of the projects:
```
npm install
```

3. Run the server with the command:
```
npm start
```

4. Start an Emulator (can be from Android Studio or XCode)
Check documentation for each OS

5. To run the app ( Android Only):
```
react-native run-android
```

# Apps

## Albums

Simple app with a ScrollView to show a few albums of a singer based on API calls.

## Auth

Auth is a app that uses Firebase to authenticate a login. It allows to people to register by only creating users and logging without a login form.

## Techstack

Techstack is an app that uses Redux with hardcoded data (intentionally) to introduce to the idea of Redux. It shows some JS libraries and a small description with it.
